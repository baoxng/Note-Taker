# Note-Taker üìã‚úèÔ∏è

## Project Description
As a developer I want to create an application that allows users to save their ideas into a note pad and they can delete it whenever they want to. This application is easy to use, for users to get started they just have to click on "Get Started". After this page user is routed to the note creation page. In order to add notes user can click on the pencil icon on the upper right hand side. User can save their notes with the save icon, all save icon are accessible on the left hand side. If the user feels the need to delete their note they just click on the note they want to delete and use the delete icon.

## Development and Challenges

The most difficult part for this application was getting the routes to work with all the other files in different folders. If the joining of the folders were incorrect the css and javascript will not work. I had lots of fun learning about express. Express webpage has a lot of good documentation making it easier to understand how to use it for routing. I learned a lot about GET, POST and DELETE request. I also learned how to use postman after it's update to troubleshoot my post requests.
